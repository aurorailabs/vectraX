# 🚨 Your Site Isn't Showing in Google - Here's Why & How to Fix It

## ✅ This is COMPLETELY NORMAL!

When you search `vectrax.in` in Google and nothing shows up, **this is expected** for a new website. Google doesn't automatically know about your site - you need to tell them!

## 🎯 The Problem

- Your site is live at https://vectrax.in/ ✅
- But Google hasn't discovered it yet ❌
- Google needs to be told about your site first

## 🚀 The Solution: Submit to Google Search Console (Takes 10 Minutes)

This is the **ONLY WAY** to get Google to index your site quickly. Without this, it could take weeks or months.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Google Search Console
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://search.google.com/search-console**
3. Sign in with your Google account (use the same account you want to manage the site with)

### Step 2: Add Your Website
1. Click the **"Add Property"** button (top left)
2. Select **"URL prefix"** (not Domain)
3. Type: `https://vectrax.in/`
4. Click **"Continue"**

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

You have **2 options** - choose the easiest one:

#### Option A: HTML File (Easiest - Recommended)
1. Google will show you a verification file name
2. You already have this file: `google878ec91e8e6fcb46.html`
3. Make sure this file is uploaded to your Hostinger `public_html` folder
4. Go back to Search Console and click **"Verify"**
5. ✅ If successful, you'll see a success message!

#### Option B: HTML Tag (If file method doesn't work)
1. In Search Console, select **"HTML tag"** method
2. Copy the meta tag code shown
3. Add it to your `public/index.html` file in the `<head>` section
4. Rebuild and upload to Hostinger
5. Go back to Search Console and click **"Verify"**

### Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap (This tells Google about all your pages)
1. After verification, you'll be in the Search Console dashboard
2. Look for **"Sitemaps"** in the left menu (under "Indexing")
3. Click **"Sitemaps"**
4. In the "Add a new sitemap" field, type: `sitemap.xml`
5. Click **"Submit"**
6. You should see: "Successfully submitted: sitemap.xml"

### Step 5: Request Indexing (This asks Google to crawl your site NOW)
1. At the top of Search Console, you'll see a search bar that says "Inspect any URL"
2. Type: `https://vectrax.in/`
3. Press Enter
4. Click the **"Request Indexing"** button
5. You'll see: "Indexing requested" - this means Google will crawl your site within hours!

### Step 6: Request Indexing for Other Pages
Repeat Step 5 for these URLs:
- `https://vectrax.in/#about`
- `https://vectrax.in/#services`
- `https://vectrax.in/#contact`
