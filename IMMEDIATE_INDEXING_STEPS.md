# Immediate Steps to Get Your Site Indexed in Google

## ⏰ Yes, You Need to Wait - But Here's How to Speed It Up!

Google indexing typically takes **24-48 hours to several days**. However, you can speed up the process significantly by following these steps.

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Do These Steps RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Submit to Google Search Console (MOST IMPORTANT!)

This is the **fastest way** to get Google to notice your site:

1. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Add Your Property**
   - Click "Add Property"
   - Select "URL prefix"
   - Enter: `https://vectrax.in/`
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Verify Ownership**
   - You have the file `google878ec91e8e6fcb46.html` in your public folder
   - Make sure this file is uploaded to your Hostinger `public_html` directory
   - In Search Console, select "HTML file upload" method
   - Google should automatically detect the file
   - Click "Verify"

   **OR** use the HTML tag method:
   - Copy the meta tag from Search Console
   - Add it to your `public/index.html` in the `<head>` section
   - Rebuild and redeploy
   - Click "Verify"

4. **Submit Your Sitemap** (This tells Google about all your pages)
   - In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
   - This can take 24-48 hours to process

5. **Request Indexing** (This asks Google to crawl your site immediately)
   - Go to "URL Inspection" tool (top search bar)
   - Enter: `https://vectrax.in/`
   - Click "Request Indexing"
   - Google will crawl your site within minutes to hours (instead of days!)

### Step 2: Request Indexing for All Important Pages

Repeat the "Request Indexing" step for:
- `https://vectrax.in/`
- `https://vectrax.in/#home`
- `https://vectrax.in/#about`
- `https://vectrax.in/#services`
- `https://vectrax.in/#contact`

**Note**: After requesting indexing, it usually takes **15 minutes to 2 hours** for Google to crawl and index the page.

## ⏱️ Timeline Expectations
