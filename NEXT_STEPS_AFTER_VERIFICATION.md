## 🚀 What You Still Need to Do (2 More Steps)

### Step 2: Submit Your Sitemap (Tells Google About All Your Pages)

1. **In Google Search Console**, look at the **left sidebar menu**
2. Find **"Sitemaps"** (it's under "Indexing" section)
3. Click on **"Sitemaps"**
4. You'll see a section that says **"Add a new sitemap"**
5. In the text field, type: `sitemap.xml`
6. Click the **"Submit"** button
7. ✅ You should see: **"Successfully submitted: sitemap.xml"**

**Why this matters**: This tells Google about all the pages on your website.

### Step 3: Request Indexing (Asks Google to Crawl Your Site NOW)

1. **At the top of Google Search Console**, you'll see a **search bar** that says:
   - "Inspect any URL" or "Inspect URL"
2. **Type**: `https://vectrax.in/`
3. **Press Enter** or click the search icon
4. You'll see a page with details about your URL
5. Look for a button that says **"Request Indexing"** (usually at the top right)
6. **Click "Request Indexing"**
7. ✅ You should see: **"Indexing requested"** or **"URL added to indexing queue"**

**Why this matters**: Without this, Google might take weeks to discover your site. This tells them to crawl it immediately (within hours).
